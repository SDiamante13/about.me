      "reference": "Steven stepped into the Anchor role of the Member-Search API with an energy and enthusiasm that could not be appreciated more. Though he was initially set up for failure with a sudden rotation and no time to transition, he has thrived. Steven has taken a wholistic approach to development, starting his tenure on the team with identifying areas of the code that could be refactored and made more efficient. Steven has been a key contributor to the documentation and administrative requirements and has held the weight of an initially underperforming team of developers. As his team matured, Steven has led implementation of processes to improve the quality of the delivery. Steven regularly examines how our deployments could be performed more dependably and safely and he has taken suggestion from the team for tools and implementations that have made for a more resilient and reliable micro-service. Steven has been an incredible team player and a staunch proponent of listening to his team and adopting suggestion for improvements. Iâ€™ve observed principles of learning from scenarios with unexpected results. Any critical feedback for improvement has been rendered irrelevant by his constant application of improving in the moment from these results. Steven has been a wonderful partner in managing the product and all of our success is due to the collaborative approach to all deliveries.",
